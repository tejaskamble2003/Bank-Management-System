# Bank-Management-System

The “Bank Account Management System” project is a model Internet Banking Site. This site enables the customers to perform the basic banking transactions by sitting at their office or at homes through PC or laptop. The system provides the access to the customer to create an account, deposit/withdraw the cash from his account, also to view reports of all accounts present. The customers can access the banks website for viewing their Account details and perform the transactions on account as per their requirements. With Internet Banking, the brick and mortar structure of the traditional banking gets converted into a click and portal model, thereby giving a concept of virtual banking a real shape. Thus, today's banking is no longer confined to branches. E-banking facilitates banking transactions by customers round the clock globally. 

The primary aim of this “Bank Account Management System” is to provide an improved design methodology, which envisages the future expansion, and modification, which is necessary for a core sector like banking. This necessitates the design to be expandable and modifiable and so a modular approach is used in developing the application software.
